#### Description
The first systematic records of weather began to be kept in Ancient China. As early as the 4th century BC, Chinese astronomers kept records of meteorological phenomena such as winds, precipitation and fogs, which they considered in the context of astrological predictions and effects on crops. In Europe, one of the first to systematically record weather data was the Italian scientist Francesco Petrarca in the 14th century. He recorded weather observations during his travels and studies.

However, systematic and daily records of weather as we understand them today began much later. The first coordinated and systematic meteorological observations on a regular basis began with the work of Ludwig von Butch in Germany and the founding in 1780 of the Societas Meteorologica Palatina (Mannheimer Meteorologische Gesellschaft) in Mannheim, Germany, which is one of the first meteorological societies in the world.

The DSMP program is a tool that can tell you about the current weather anywhere in the world, warn about extreme weather conditions, and provide complete information about basic weather metrics. The program can also store the history of recordings, add notes to the data and read them conveniently in the console.

The program uses a free API - https://www.weatherapi.com/

For the program to work correctly, you need to add your API key in the project.py file:
```python
api_key = "PUT_YOUR_API_KEY"
```
